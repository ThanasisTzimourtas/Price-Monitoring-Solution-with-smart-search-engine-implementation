# Price notifier with smart search engine
 Many times we want to know when a product we are interested in has a price we want. However, we can not open the Skroutz website every day and check if and how much the price of the product we want has changed.
 This program informs the user about the product he/she is interesting in when the price of the product has dropped, by sending an email with the information of the product. 
 However, in order for the program to run properly, the user must always have the terminal open.

 Notes:
    • This program was created to check the products from the Greek website Skroutz.gr
    • In the future it will be converted to windows service so that it can work in the background without the user having to keep his terminal open.
    • The program has some small bugs when the website contains many Greek characters. In the near future this problem will be fixed.
