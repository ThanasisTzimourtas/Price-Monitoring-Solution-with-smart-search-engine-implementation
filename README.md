# Price Monitoring Solution with smart search engine implementation
 Every customer of an ecommerce site wants to monitor products for price changes, so they can make the right purchase at the right time. The largest ecommerce site in Greece is    skroutz.gr and such tasks are time consuming for a user.
The purpose of this application is to automate this task and inform the user whenever price changes occur. These alerts are sent via email to the user. Since this is still in beta, it is important for the user to not close the terminal while running the script.

 This program informs the user about the product he/she is interesting in when the price of the product has dropped, by sending an email with the information of the product.
However, in order for the program to run properly, the user must always have the terminal open.

 Notes:
    • This program was created to check the products from the Greek website Skroutz.gr
    • In the future it will be converted to windows service so that it can work in the background without the user having to keep his terminal open.
    • The program has some small bugs when the website contains many Greek characters. In the near future this problem will be fixed.
